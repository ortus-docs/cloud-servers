# Windows Based Images

Create an ec2 instance from an Ortus Lucee CFML engine \(Windows Server 2019\) AMI \(Amazon Machine Image\).  We have created several Windows-based images.

## Lucee Versions

We have created images that support different Lucee Versions. Please note that you can update and patch each instance as you see fit as well.
