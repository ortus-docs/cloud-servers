# Managing your web site

Now that you have a site running in the cloud you will want to customize it. Remember that SSH pem file you downloaded. That is going to allow you to go on the server and edit files. If you are on a windows platform like me. Here are some tools I strongly suggest that you get.

1. CommandBox. This tool will allow you to make files and remove them locally. If you so decide that you want to edit and add files directly on the EC2 instance this can be done using the default instance of CommandBox on the server.

2. VSCode the editor of choice, and the reason I say that is because it has so many useful extensions. [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
3. WinSCP the default file manager tool for Windows. [https://winscp.net/eng/index.php](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)

If you are using the Windows Package Manager Cocolatey you can download all of these from there.
