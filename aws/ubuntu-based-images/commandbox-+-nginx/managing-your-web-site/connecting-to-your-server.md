# Connecting to your server

This page will walk you through connecting to your new server using the popular free software program WinSCP. I have a script for you to download on step 11 "[Managing your web site](./)" page. We will also take a look at an exciting VSCode extension called [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack). It allows you to SSH directly to the EC2 instance and map the remote folder in your local VSCode IDE.
